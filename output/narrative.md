The road condition assessment was conducted through analysis of twelve dashcam frames collected along the surveyed section. The pavement surface was consistently paved throughout, with condition ratings distributed as ten frames classified as fair condition, one frame as good condition, and one frame as poor condition. The predominant condition classification for this road section was therefore fair, indicating a pavement structure that remains functional but exhibits notable deterioration requiring attention.

The average International Roughness Index (IRI) was measured at 7.6 m/km, which falls within the range typically associated with fair to poor ride quality and suggests that road users would experience moderate discomfort during transit. Multiple distress types were identified throughout the assessment, including corrugation, cracking, erosion, patching, raveling, and rutting. This combination of surface distresses indicates that the pavement has experienced significant structural and surface deterioration from traffic loading, environmental factors, and insufficient maintenance interventions. The presence of patching suggests that reactive maintenance has been attempted, though the persistence of multiple distress types indicates that more comprehensive rehabilitation measures would be required to restore the road to a good serviceable condition and prevent further accelerated deterioration.
