The road condition assessment was conducted through dashcam video analysis covering 20 representative frames along the corridor. The evaluation revealed predominantly poor conditions, with 10 frames (50%) classified as poor, 8 frames (40%) as fair, and only 2 frames (10%) achieving good condition ratings. The dominant surface type was identified as earth, indicating an unpaved roadway, and the average International Roughness Index (IRI) was measured at 9.4 m/km, which significantly exceeds acceptable standards for comfortable and safe vehicle operation.

Multiple distress types were observed throughout the assessed section, reflecting advanced deterioration and inadequate maintenance intervention. The documented distresses included corrugation, cracking, edge break, erosion, patching, raveling, and rutting, demonstrating compound failure mechanisms affecting both the surface integrity and structural capacity of the roadway. The prevalence of erosion and rutting patterns suggests inadequate drainage management and surface water control, while the presence of corrugation is characteristic of unpaved roads subjected to regular traffic loading without proper grading maintenance. These conditions collectively indicate that the road has exceeded its functional service life and requires substantial rehabilitation investment to restore adequate service levels and ensure safe passage for road users.
