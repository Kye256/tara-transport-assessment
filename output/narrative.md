The road condition assessment was conducted through dashcam analysis covering 244 frames along the corridor. The pavement surface was predominantly earth material, which presented significant serviceability challenges. The International Roughness Index (IRI) measured 8.6 m/km, substantially exceeding acceptable thresholds for comfortable vehicle operation and indicating a road surface in poor functional condition. The condition distribution revealed that 64% of the assessed sections were rated as fair, while 22% were classified as poor and only 14% achieved a good rating, demonstrating overall substandard road quality requiring substantial intervention.

Multiple distress types were evident throughout the corridor, including corrugation, edge break, erosion, patching, raveling, and rutting. These distresses are characteristic of unpaved earth roads subjected to traffic loading and environmental weathering without adequate maintenance. The prevalence of erosion and rutting indicated inadequate drainage management and surface water control, while the presence of corrugation suggested vehicle speed and material plasticity issues. The combination of high IRI values and the predominance of fair to poor condition ratings indicated that the road was operating below acceptable service standards, likely resulting in increased vehicle operating costs, reduced travel speeds, and compromised safety for road users. Significant capital investment in surface improvement or reconstruction would be required to bring the facility to an acceptable level of service.
