The road condition assessment was conducted through dashcam video analysis covering 20 representative frames along the corridor. The pavement surface was predominantly earth, with the asset exhibiting significant deterioration throughout the assessed section. The condition distribution revealed that 55% of frames were rated as poor, while 45% were classified as fair, with no sections achieving good or excellent ratings. The average International Roughness Index (IRI) was measured at 9.5 m/km, indicating a rough riding surface that substantially exceeds acceptable thresholds for passenger comfort and vehicle operating costs.

The assessment identified a comprehensive range of surface distresses that reflect advanced deterioration and inadequate maintenance intervention. Notable defects included corrugation, cracking, edge break, erosion, patching, raveling, and rutting. The prevalence of these distress types, particularly in combination, suggests both structural inadequacy and the effects of water infiltration and inadequate drainage. The earth surface material, coupled with the observed erosion and rutting patterns, indicates vulnerability to weather-related degradation and limited all-weather accessibility. These conditions present significant serviceability concerns and would result in elevated vehicle operating costs, reduced traffic speeds, and potential safety hazards for road users. Immediate rehabilitation or reconstruction investment would be required to restore the corridor to an acceptable service level.
