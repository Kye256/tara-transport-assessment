The road condition assessment was conducted through dashcam video analysis covering 20 individual frames along the corridor. The evaluation revealed predominantly poor surface conditions, with 15 frames (75%) classified as poor and 5 frames (25%) classified as fair. No sections met good or excellent condition standards. The average International Roughness Index (IRI) was measured at 12.7 m/km, which significantly exceeds acceptable thresholds for passenger vehicle comfort and indicates severe roughness that typically necessitates reduced operating speeds and results in increased vehicle operating costs.

The pavement surface was identified as unpaved earth, which presented multiple categories of distress throughout the assessed length. Observable deterioration included corrugation, cracking, edge break, erosion, patching, and rutting. These distress types collectively indicate inadequate drainage, insufficient structural capacity, and ongoing deterioration from traffic loading and environmental factors. The prevalence of rutting and corrugation suggests regular traffic use combined with minimal maintenance intervention, while the presence of erosion and edge break points to water-related damage that compromises the structural integrity of the running surface. The current condition of this road asset represents a substantial operational liability and would require significant capital investment to achieve a maintainable standard suitable for reliable vehicular access.
