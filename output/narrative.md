The condition assessment was conducted through systematic analysis of 20 dashcam frames captured along the road corridor. The assessment revealed a predominantly fair condition rating across 12 frames (60%), with good conditions observed in only 1 frame (5%) and poor conditions documented in 7 frames (35%). The average International Roughness Index (IRI) was measured at 8.9 m/km, which significantly exceeds acceptable thresholds for paved roads and indicates a rough riding surface that would impact vehicle operating costs and user comfort.

The road surface was identified as an earth road throughout the assessed section, which accounts for the elevated roughness levels and the range of distress types observed. Field observations documented multiple forms of deterioration including corrugation, cracking, erosion, patching, potholes, raveling, and rutting. This combination of distress indicators suggests inadequate surface maintenance and vulnerability to weather-related degradation. The prevalence of erosion and rutting patterns indicates insufficient drainage infrastructure and the effects of traffic loading on an unsealed surface. The current condition distribution and high IRI value suggest that without significant intervention, including potential surface upgrading or comprehensive rehabilitation, the road will continue to deteriorate and impose increasing costs on road users while limiting accessibility during adverse weather conditions.
