The road condition assessment was conducted through dashcam analysis of 20 frames along the surveyed section. The pavement condition distribution revealed that 13 frames (65%) exhibited poor condition, while 7 frames (35%) were classified as fair condition, with no sections meeting good condition standards. The average International Roughness Index (IRI) was recorded at 9.7 m/km, which significantly exceeds acceptable thresholds for vehicular comfort and safety, indicating a severely deteriorated road surface requiring immediate attention.

The dominant surface type was identified as earth, and the overall condition was classified as poor. The assessment identified multiple distress types present throughout the surveyed section, including corrugation, cracking, erosion, patching, raveling, and rutting. These distress indicators suggest long-term deterioration due to insufficient maintenance, inadequate drainage, and the unpaved nature of the surface. The combination of high IRI values and multiple concurrent distress types indicates that this road section has surpassed routine maintenance requirements and would necessitate substantial rehabilitation or reconstruction interventions to restore adequate serviceability and ensure safe passage for users.
