The road condition assessment was conducted through systematic dashcam video analysis covering 209 frames along the surveyed route. The pavement surface was predominantly composed of earth material and exhibited poor overall condition, with 125 frames (59.8%) classified as poor and 84 frames (40.2%) classified as fair. No sections were observed to be in good condition. The measured average International Roughness Index (IRI) of 12.0 m/km significantly exceeded acceptable thresholds for serviceable road infrastructure, indicating substantial roughness that would negatively impact vehicle operating costs, travel time, and user comfort.

The assessment identified multiple critical distress types throughout the surveyed section, including corrugation, edge break, erosion, patching, potholes, raveling, and rutting. This combination of distresses indicated advanced deterioration consistent with inadequate drainage provisions, insufficient structural capacity, and deferred maintenance activities. The prevalence of erosion and rutting on the unpaved earth surface suggested significant surface material loss during wet weather conditions and inadequate surface water management. The presence of potholes and edge breaks further compromised the structural integrity and posed safety hazards to road users. Given the current condition state and the range of distresses observed, immediate rehabilitation intervention would be required to restore the route to a serviceable standard and prevent further accelerated deterioration.
