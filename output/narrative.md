The road condition assessment was conducted through systematic analysis of 244 dashcam frames collected during the field survey. The pavement condition evaluation revealed a predominantly deteriorated road network, with 90 frames (36.9%) classified as poor condition, 121 frames (49.6%) assessed as fair condition, and only 33 frames (13.5%) rated as good condition. The average International Roughness Index (IRI) was measured at 9.0 m/km, which significantly exceeds acceptable thresholds and indicates a rough riding surface that likely impacts vehicle operating costs and travel time reliability. The dominant surface type was identified as earth, confirming the unpaved nature of the road corridor.

Multiple distress types were documented throughout the assessed section, including corrugation, edge break, erosion, patching, pothole, raveling, and rutting. These distresses reflect a combination of structural inadequacy, inadequate drainage management, and insufficient routine maintenance interventions. The prevalence of erosion and rutting patterns suggests particular vulnerability during wet weather conditions, while the presence of corrugation indicates consistent traffic loading on an unpaved surface without adequate regraveling cycles. The combination of high roughness values and extensive distress manifestation indicates that the road has progressed beyond the point where routine maintenance would be cost-effective, and rehabilitation or reconstruction interventions should be prioritized in the investment programming.
